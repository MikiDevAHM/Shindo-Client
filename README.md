## Platform support
windows (working well) <br>
linux (working but some issues noticed that can be fixed by using the fps limit mod) <br>

## Future
I do not want glide to compete with [Soar Client](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient) so when [Soar Client](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient) V8 releases this project will be instantly archived
